      <h1>Play Jeopardy: AI-generated quizzes (English)</h1>
      <article>
        <p>Jeopardy AI Quiz offers a fast, intuitive way to generate and play Jeopardy-style quizzes using artificial intelligence. Whether you're preparing classroom activities, organizing a pub quiz night, or testing your own knowledge, the platform enables you to create tailored quizzes within seconds. Choose topics such as history, science, music, sports, and film; the AI will produce five categories each containing five graded questions (100–500 points) with concise, verifiable answers.</p>

        <p>The platform supports team play and live scoring. After generation, each quiz can be saved and shared through a unique link so participants can revisit or continue the game later. Teachers can use the tool to create instant review materials, while social groups and event organizers can rapidly prepare themed quiz sessions without spending hours writing questions manually.</p>

        <p>Quality and clarity are central: generated items follow rules to avoid ambiguity and ensure that each question has a single correct answer. Difficulty scales from easy introductory prompts to challenging expert-level items, making the quizzes suitable for a wide audience. Short answers make scoring straightforward and maintain game flow.</p>

        <p>This English landing at <strong>https://jeopardyonline.it/en/</strong> provides the game experience, while the Italian version is available at <strong>https://jeopardyonline.it/it/</strong>. Both versions offer the same gameplay, with content generated based on the selected language.</p>
        <p>Start by clicking "Create AI Quiz" in the app interface, select your preferred categories and language, and get a complete quiz instantly. For developers and integrators, the platform exposes shareable links for each saved quiz, enabling easy embedding in LMS or event pages.</p>

        <p>Find the Italian landing at <a href="/it/">https://jeopardyonline.it/it/</a> and the main site at <a href="/">https://jeopardyonline.it/</a>. If you want me to also generate per-quiz static pages or add a server-side prerender for crawler-specific rendering, I can help implement that as a next step.</p>
